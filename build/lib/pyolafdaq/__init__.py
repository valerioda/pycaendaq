__version__ = "0.1.0"

# You can also import submodules here to make them directly accessible
# when someone imports the package. For example:
# from . import daq_scope
# from . import app

# If you want to control what is exposed when a user does `from py_olaf_daq import *`,
# you can define the __all__ variable:
# __all__ = ["daq_scope", "app"]

# For now, a simple version definition is sufficient.
# The daq_scope and app modules will be accessible via
# `import py_olaf_daq.daq_scope` and `import py_olaf_daq.app` respectively.
