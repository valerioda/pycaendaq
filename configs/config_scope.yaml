  group1:
    channel_list: "range(0,2)"
    chenable: "True" # (STRING) ['True', 'False'] Enable channel for the acquisition. When the channel is disabled, it doesn't give any data and its self-trigger is off.
    chsupprsamplesoverthreshold: 1 # (NUMBER) [] Samples over thredhold for channel suppression
    chsupprthr: 0 # (NUMBER) [] Threshold for channel suppression. Configuration parameters TriggerThrMode and SelfTriggerEdge shared with TriggerThr.
    dcoffset: 10 # (NUMBER) [] A constant DC offset (controlled by a 16 bit DAC) is added to the analog input in order to adjust the position of the signal baseline.
    itlconnect: "Disabled" # (STRING) ['Disabled', 'ITLA', 'ITLB'] Determine if the channel partecipate to ITLA or ITLB.
    overthresholdvetowidth: 0 # (NUMBER) [] Veto width to discard triggers when crossing the threshold in the opposite direction to the trigger one
    samplesoverthreshold: 1 # (NUMBER) [] Samples over threshold
    selftriggeredge: "RISE" # (STRING) ['RISE', 'FALL'] The self-trigger can be issued on either the rising or falling crossing of the threshold. Used also by ChSupprThr.
    selftriggerwidth: "8" # (STRING) [] Width of the self-trigger. 0 means linear mode
    signaloffset: 0 # (NUMBER) [] Offset of the input signal.
    triggerthr: 0 # (NUMBER) [] Threshold value in ADC counts. The value is relative to the baseline.
    triggerthrmode: "Relative" # (STRING) ['Relative', 'Absolute'] Defines whether the trigger threshold is relative to the baseline or absolute. Used also by ChSupprThr.
